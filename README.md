# Customer Churn Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
The goal is to analyze customer data, identify key factors influencing churn, and create predictive models that can help businesses improve customer retention.

## About Customer Churn
Customer churn occurs when customers stop doing business with a company.  
- Churn is one of the most critical business metrics.  
- Predicting churn helps companies identify at-risk customers.  
- By analyzing patterns in customer behavior, organizations can take preventive actions (offers, engagement, loyalty programs).  
- Machine learning enables data-driven insights that go beyond simple rule-based approaches.

## Project Objectives
Using a structured dataset of customer details, this project aims to answer:
1. Which factors most influence customer churn?  
2. What preprocessing is required to handle categorical and numerical variables?  
3. Which machine learning models perform best for churn prediction?  
4. How well can we predict churn using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score?

## Key Insights
- Data preprocessing included handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed patterns such as higher churn rates in certain demographics and contract types.  
- Multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree) were tested.  
- The best performing model achieved strong recall and balanced accuracy, making it effective for identifying churned customers.
